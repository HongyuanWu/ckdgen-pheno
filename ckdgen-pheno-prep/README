Usage instructions

1. Rename the parameters file to reflect your study, e.g.
	"cp params-template params-gckd"

2. Edit the parameters file to reflect your input file.
   The parameters file itself contains detailed instructions.

3. Run the phenotype generation script, passing the parameters file, e.g.
	"./ckdgen-pheno-prep.sh params-gckd"

4. Output is written both to the screen and to a log file. Please examine
   the output carefully. If there are problems, please try to fix the
   parameters in the parameters file or the data in your input file. 
   If you need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.


The script has been tested both on Linux and Windows systems with
different R versions (3.0.x, 3.2.x and 3.3.0/3.3.1).
If something does not work for you, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Please state the R version you are using.

For Windows, please use Cygwin and ensure "Rscript" is in your PATH.




INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEDIATRIC STUDIES

For pediatric studies, we provide a version of the script which uses
the exponential Schwartz equation to calculate the baseline (and follow-up) eGFR.

In order to use this script, your input data file needs additional columns:

* The column "height" with the height of the individual (unit: "cm") at the timepoint of
  serum creatinine measurement is mandatory. 
* The column "height_fu" with the height (unit: "cm") at the timepoint of follow-up
  is optional.
  
The parameters file is unchanged.

Please use this call:
	"./ckdgen-pheno-prep-pediatric.sh params-pediatric"
